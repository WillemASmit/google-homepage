In this project I attempted at reproducing the homepage of Google.co.za.
Apart from the logos that are not perfect, the homepage is correct. This is
the very first page I have written and the purpose of this excersize was to 
practice my front end programming skills. Most of my time in this project
went into spacing all the different div's in my html code using CSS.
